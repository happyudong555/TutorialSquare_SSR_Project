## Getting started

1. Add `react-hot-loader/babel` to your `.babelrc`:
>>>>>>> 3e7cc9eba236ff5c5205c34bae31be88b995768b

```js
// .babelrc
{
  "plugins": ["react-hot-loader/babel"]
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
2.  Mark your root component as _hot-exported_:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

const App = () => <div>Hello World!</div>

export default hot(module)(App)
```

3.  [Run Webpack with Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/#enabling-hmr):

```sh
webpack-dev-server --hot
```

## Recipes

### Migrating from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

1.  Run `npm run eject`
2.  Install React Hot Loader (`npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader`)
3.  In `config/webpack.config.dev.js`, add `'react-hot-loader/babel'` to Babel
    loader configuration. The loader should now look like:

```js
  {
    test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
    include: paths.appSrc,
    loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
    options: {
      // This is a feature of `babel-loader` for Webpack (not Babel itself).
      // It enables caching results in ./node_modules/.cache/babel-loader/
      // directory for faster rebuilds.
      cacheDirectory: true,
      plugins: ['react-hot-loader/babel'],
    },
  }
```

4.  Mark your App (`src/index.js`) as _hot-exported_:

```js
// ./containers/App.js
import React from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

const App = () => <div>Hello World!</div>

export default hot(module)(App)
```

### Migrating from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) without ejecting

Users [report](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/pull/729#issuecomment-354097936), that it is possible to use [react-app-rewire-hot-loader](https://github.com/cdharris/react-app-rewire-hot-loader) to setup React-hot-loader without ejecting.
Follow [these code examples](https://github.com/Grimones/cra-rhl/commit/4ed74af2dc649301695f67df05a12f210fb7820c) to repeat the approach.

### TypeScript

When using TypeScript, Babel is not required, but React Hot Loader will not work (properly) without it.
Just add `babel-loader` into your Webpack configuration, with React Hot Loader plugin.

There are 2 different ways to do it.

##### Add babel AFTER typescript.

```js
{
  test: /\.tsx?$/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      options: {
        babelrc: false,
        plugins: ['react-hot-loader/babel'],
      },
    },
    'ts-loader', // (or awesome-typescript-loader)
  ],
}
```

In this case you have to modify your `tsconfig.json`, and compile to ES6 mode, as long as React-Hot-Loader babel plugin does not understand ES5 code.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "module": "commonjs",
  "target": "es6"
}
```

As long you cannot ship ES6 to production, you can create a `tsconfig.dev.json`, "extend" the base tsconfig and use "dev" config in dev webpack build
. Details
for [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#configfile-string-defaulttsconfigjson)
, for [awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#configfilename-string-defaulttsconfigjson).

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6"
=======
2. [Enable Hot Module Replacement in Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/#enabling-hmr)

3. Add `react-hot-loader/patch` at the top of the entry section (except polyfills) of your Webpack config:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: [
    'babel-polyfill',
    'react-hot-loader/patch',
    './main.js'
  ]
}
```

4. Wrap your application into `<AppContainer>`, all children of `<AppContainer>` will be reloaded when a change occurs:

```js
// main.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'
import App from './containers/App'

const render = Component => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <AppContainer>
      <Component />
    </AppContainer>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  )
}

render(App)

// Webpack Hot Module Replacement API
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => { render(App) })
}
```

> Note: To make this work, you'll need to opt out of Babel transpiling ES2015 modules by changing the Babel ES2015 preset to be `["es2015", { "modules": false }]`

## Using Webpack loader instead of Babel plugin

You may not use Babel in your project, React Hot Loader provides a Webpack loader with **[limited support](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#known-limitations)**. If you want to use it, you can add it in your Webpack config. **If you use Babel, you don't need to add this loader**.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        use: ['react-hot-loader/webpack']
      }
    ]
>>>>>>> 3e7cc9eba236ff5c5205c34bae31be88b995768b
  }
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Keep in mind - awesome-typescript-loader [has a built in feature](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#usebabel-boolean-defaultfalse) (`useBabel`) to _babelify_ result.

##### Add babel BEFORE typescript

> Note: this way requires babel 7 and [babel-loader@^8.0.0](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader#install)

```js
{
  test: /\.tsx?$/,
  use: [
    'ts-loader', // (or awesome-typescript-loader)
    {
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      options: {
        plugins: [
          '@babel/plugin-syntax-typescript',
          '@babel/plugin-syntax-decorators',
          '@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx',
          'react-hot-loader/babel',
        ],
      },
    }
  ],
}
```

In this case you can compile to ES5. More about [typescript and react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/884)

We also have a [full example running TypeScript + React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples/typescript).

### Parcel

Parcel supports Hot Module Reloading out of the box, just follow step 1 and 2 of [Getting Started](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master#getting-started).

We also have a [full example running Parcel + React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples/parcel).

### Electron

1.  Add `react-hot-loader/babel` to your `.compilerc`:

```js
// .compilerc
{
  "plugins": ["react-hot-loader/babel"]
}
```

2.  Enable Live Reload in the project

```js
enableLiveReload({ strategy: 'react-hmr' })
```

See a [complete example](https://github.com/rllola/hmr-example-issue-2/blob/master/src/index.js).

### Source Maps

If you use `devtool: 'source-map'` (or its equivalent), source maps will be
emitted to hide hot reloading code.

Source maps slow down your project. Use `devtool: 'eval'` for best build
performance.

Hot reloading code is just one line in the beginning and one line at the end of
each module so you might not need source maps at all.

### React Native

React Native
**[supports hot reloading natively](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)**
as of version 0.22.

Using React Hot Loader with React Native can cause unexpected issues (see #824) and is not recommended.

### Code Splitting

Most of modern React component-loader libraries are not "100%" compatible with React-Hot-Loader, as long
they load deferred component on `componentWillMount`, but never reload it again.
As result - you can update the code, webpack will ship that code the the client, but nothing will be updated.

In this case, you have to setup "reloading" by your self - you have to mark your "loaded components" as _hot-exported_.

Example using [react-async-component](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component)...)

```js
// AsyncHello.js
import asyncComponent from 'react-async-component'
const AsyncHello = asyncComponent({
  resolve: () => import('./Hello.js'),
})

// Hello.js
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'
const Hello = () => 'Hello'
export default hot(module)(Hello) // <-- module will reload itself
```

Marking component as `hot` will make it self-reloadable. But this require altering your code, and sometimes
is not possible.

For a better expirence you could use more React-Hot-Loader "compatible" loaders:

* [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/) - always reloads and preloads component in development.
* [react-imported-component](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-component) - reloads component on HMR (React 16.3 compatible).
* [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) - reloads component on HMR.

### Checking Element `type`s

Because React Hot Loader creates proxied versions of your components, comparing
reference types of elements won't work:

```js
const element = <Component />
console.log(element.type === Component) // false
```

React Hot Loader exposes a function `areComponentsEqual` to make it possible:

```js
import { areComponentsEqual } from 'react-hot-loader'
const element = <Component />
areComponentsEqual(element.type, Component) // true
```

### Webpack ExtractTextPlugin

Webpack ExtractTextPlugin is not compatible with React Hot Loader. Please disable it in development:

```js
new ExtractTextPlugin({
  filename: 'styles/[name].[contenthash].css',
  disable: NODE_ENV !== 'production',
})
```

## API

### `hot(module, options)`

Mark a component as hot.

```js
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

const App = () => 'Hello World!'

export default hot(module)(App)
```

### `AppContainer`

Mark application as hot reloadable. Prefer using `hot` helper.

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'
import App from './containers/App'

const render = Component => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <AppContainer>
      <Component />
    </AppContainer>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  )
}

render(App)

// Webpack Hot Module Replacement API
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => {
    // if you are using harmony modules ({modules:false})
    render(App)
    // in all other cases - re-require App manually
    render(require('./containers/App'))
  })
}
```

### areComponentsEqual(Component1, Component2)

Test if two components have the same type.

```js
import { areComponentsEqual } from 'react-hot-loader'
import Component1 from './Component1'
import Component2 from './Component2'

areComponentsEqual(Component1, Component2) // true or false
```

### setConfig(config)

Set a new configuration for React Hot Loader.

Available options are:

* `logLevel`: specify log level, default to `"error"`, available values are: `['debug', 'log', 'warn', 'error']`

```js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader'

setConfig({ logLevel: 'debug' })
```

## Migrating from v3

### AppContainer vs hot

Prior v4 the right way to setup React Hot Loader was to wrap your Application
with `AppContainer`, set setup module acceptance by yourself. This approach is
still valid but only for advanced use cases, prefer using `hot` helper.

**React Hot Loader v3:**

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react'

const App = () => <div>Hello world!</div>

export default App
```

```js
// main.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'
import App from './containers/App'

const render = Component => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <AppContainer>
      <Component />
    </AppContainer>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  )
}

render(App)

// Webpack Hot Module Replacement API
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => {
    // if you are using harmony modules ({modules:false})
    render(App)
    // in all other cases - re-require App manually
    render(require('./containers/App'))
  })
}
```

**React Hot Loader v4:**

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

const App = () => <div>Hello world!</div>

export default hot(module)(App)
```

```js
// main.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './containers/App'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### No patch required

Code is automatically patched, you can safely remove `react-hot-loader/patch`
from your Webpack config.

### Error reporter is gone

React supports error handling out of the box since v16 using `componentDidCatch`. You can create your own [Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries) and install it after `hot` has been applied:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary'

const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <div>Hello world!</div>
  </ErrorBoundary>
)

export default hot(module)(App)
```

## Known limitations and side effects

### Not about `hot`

`hot` accepts only React Component (Stateful or Stateless), resulting the `HotExported` variant of it.
The `hot` function will setup current module to _self-accept_ itself on reload, and will **ignore** all the changes, made for non-React components.
You may mark as many modules as you want. But `HotExportedComponent` **should be the only used export** of a _hot_-module.

> Note: Please note how often we have used `exported` keyword. `hot` is for exports.

> Note: Does nothing in production mode, just passes App through.

### New Components keep executing the old code

There is no way to hot-update constructor code, as result even new components
will be born as the first ones, and then grow into the last ones. As of today, this issue cannot be solved.

## Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work, in 99% of cases it's a configuration issue. A missing option, a
wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way
to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup,
check out
**[examples](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples)**,
bit by bit.

If something doesn't work, in 99% of cases it's an issue with your code. The Component
didn't get registered, due to HOC or Decorator around it, which is making it
invisible to the Babel plugin or Webpack loader.

We're also gathering
**[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)**
so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!

### Switch into debug mode

Debug mode adds additional warnings and can tells you why React Hot Loader is
not working properly in your application.

```js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader'
setConfig({ logLevel: 'debug' })
```

=======
## Migrating from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

* Run `npm run eject`
* Install React Hot Loader (`npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader`)
* In `config/webpack.config.dev.js`:
  1. Add `'react-hot-loader/patch'` to entry array (anywhere before `paths.appIndexJs`). It should now look like (excluding comments):
  ```js
    entry: [
       'react-hot-loader/patch',
       require.resolve('react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient'),
       require.resolve('./polyfills'),
       paths.appIndexJs
    ]
  ```

  2. Add `'react-hot-loader/babel'` to Babel loader configuration. The loader should now look like:
  ```js
    {
       test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
       include: paths.appSrc,
       loader: 'babel',
       query: {
         cacheDirectory: findCacheDir({
           name: 'react-scripts'
         }),
         plugins: [
           'react-hot-loader/babel'
         ]
       }
    }
  ```

* Add `AppContainer` to `src/index.js` (see step 4 of Getting Started).

## TypeScript

When using TypeScript, Babel is not required, so your config should look like ([demo](https://github.com/Glavin001/react-hot-ts)):

```js
{
  test: /\.tsx?$/,
  loaders: ['react-hot-loader/webpack', 'ts-loader'] // (or awesome-typescript-loader)
}
```

## Source Maps

If you use `devtool: 'source-map'` (or its equivalent), source maps will be emitted to hide hot reloading code.

Source maps slow down your project. Use `devtool: 'eval'` for best build performance.

Hot reloading code is just one line in the beginning and one line in the end of each module so you might not need source maps at all.

## React Native

React Native **[supports hot reloading natively](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)** as of version 0.22.

## Adding a custom error reporter

The previously used `Redbox` for React Hot Loader has known limitations due to sourcemaps and it's no longer a default catcher. Errors are great to clearly see rendering issues, and avoiding an uncaught error from breaking your app. But there are some advantages to a thrown error in the console too, like filename resolution via sourcemaps, and click-to-open. To get the `Redbox` back, and have the best of both worlds, modify your app entry point as follows:

```js
import Redbox from 'redbox-react';

const CustomErrorReporter = ({ error }) => <Redbox error={ error } />;

CustomErrorReporter.propTypes = {
  error: React.PropTypes.instanceOf(Error).isRequired
};

render((
  <AppContainer errorReporter={ CustomErrorReporter }>
    <AppRoot />
  </AppContainer>
), document.getElementById('react-root'));
```

You'll also need to `npm install --save-dev redbox-react`.

## Disable warnings

React Hot Loader will by default emit a warning for components not accepted by the Hot Loader. If you want to disable these warnings, you can pass a `warnings` prop with the value `false` to `AppContainer`.

```js
<AppContainer warnings={false}>
  ...
</AppContainer>
```

## Known limitations

### Components not replaced

- React Hot Loader can't replace any Component, only *registered* ones.
  - when using webpack loader - only module exports are _registered_.
  - when using babel plugin - only top level variables are _registered_.
  - when React Hot Loader can't replace Component, an error message will be displayed.

### Code Splitting

If you want to use Webpack code splitting via `require.ensure`, you'll need to add an additional `module.hot.accept` callback within the `require.ensure` block, like this:

```js
require.ensure([], (require) => {
  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept('../components/App', () => {
      loadComponent(require('../components/App').default);
    })
  }
  loadComponent(require('../components/App').default);
});
```

Note that if you're using React Router (pre-4.0), this will only work with `getChildRoutes`, but not `getComponent`, since `getComponent`'s callback will only load a component once.

Also, if you're using the Webpack 2 beta, you can use `System.import` without extra `module.hot.accept` calls, although there are still a [few issues with it](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/303).

### Checking Element `type`s

Because React Hot Loader creates proxied versions of your components, comparing reference types of elements won't work:

```js
const element = <Component />;
console.log(element.type === Component); // false
```

One workaround is to create an element (that will have the `type` of the proxied component):

```js
const ComponentType = (<Component />).type;
const element = <Component />;
console.log(element.type === ComponentType); // true
```

You can also set a property on the component class:

```js
const Widget = () => <div>hi</div>;
Widget.isWidgetType = true;
console.log(<Widget />.type.isWidgetType); // true
```

### Reassigning Components

React Hot Loader will only try to reload the original component reference, so if you reassign it to another variable like this:

```js
let App = () => (<div>hello</div>);
App = connect()(App);
export default App;
```

React Hot Loader won't reload it. Instead, you'll need to define it once:

```js
const App = () => (<div>hello</div>);
export default connect()(App);
```

### Decorators

Components that are decorated (using something like [`@autobind`](https://github.com/andreypopp/autobind-decorator)) currently do not retain state when being hot-reloaded. (see [#279](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/279))


## Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work, in 99% cases it's a configuration issue.
A missing option, a wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup, such as **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**, bit by bit.

If something doesn't work, in 99% cases it's an issue with your code - Component doesn't got registered, due to HOC or Decorator around it, which making it invisible to Babel plugin, or Webpack loader.  

We're also gathering **[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)** so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!
